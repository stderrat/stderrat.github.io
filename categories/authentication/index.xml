&lt;p>The following 1-minute article is a follow-up to my &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2025/05/step-by-step-using-keycloak-authentication-in-openshift/">previous article&lt;/a> about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. In this article, I will show you how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift for Single Log Out (SLO). This means that when you log out from Keycloak, you will also be logged out from OpenShift automatically. This requires some additional configuration in Keycloak and OpenShift, but it is not too complicated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was recently asked about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. How to install Keycloak using the Operator and how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift so that users can log in to OpenShift using OpenID.
I have to admit that the exact steps are not easy to find, so I decided to write a blog post about it, describing each step in detail.
This time I will not use GitOps, but the OpenShift and Keycloak Web Console to show the steps, because before we put it into GitOps, we need to understand what is actually happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article tries to explain every step required so that a user can authenticate to OpenShift using Keycloak as an Identity Provider (IDP) and that Groups from Keycloak are imported into OpenShift. This article does not cover a production grade installation of Keycloak, but only a test installation, so you can see how it works. For production, you might want to consider a proper database (maybe external, but at least with a backup), high availability, etc.).&lt;/p>
