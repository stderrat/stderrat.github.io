&lt;p>One of the most commonly deployed operators in OpenShift environments is the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Operator&lt;/strong>. It automates the management of TLS certificates for applications running within the cluster, including their issuance and renewal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The tool supports a variety of certificate issuers by default, including ACME, Vault, and self-signed certificates. Whenever a certificate is needed, Cert-Manager will automatically create a CertificateRequest resource that contains the details of the certificate. This resource is then processed by the appropriate issuer to generate the actual TLS certificate. The approval process in this case is usually fully automated, meaning that the certificate is issued without any manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>But what if you want to have more control? What if certificate issuance must follow strict organizational policies, such as requiring a specifc country code or organization name?
This is where the &lt;strong>CertificateRequestPolicy&lt;/strong> resource, a resource provided by the Approver Policy, comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article walks through configuring the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Approver Policy&lt;/strong> in OpenShift to enforce granular policies on certificate requests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following 1-minute article is a follow-up to my &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2025/05/step-by-step-using-keycloak-authentication-in-openshift/">previous article&lt;/a> about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. In this article, I will show you how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift for Single Log Out (SLO). This means that when you log out from Keycloak, you will also be logged out from OpenShift automatically. This requires some additional configuration in Keycloak and OpenShift, but it is not too complicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Step by Step - Using Keycloak Authentication in OpenShift</title><link>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2025/05/step-by-step-using-keycloak-authentication-in-openshift/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2025/05/step-by-step-using-keycloak-authentication-in-openshift/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>I was recently asked about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. How to install Keycloak using the Operator and how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift so that users can log in to OpenShift using OpenID.
I have to admit that the exact steps are not easy to find, so I decided to write a blog post about it, describing each step in detail.
This time I will not use GitOps, but the OpenShift and Keycloak Web Console to show the steps, because before we put it into GitOps, we need to understand what is actually happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article tries to explain every step required so that a user can authenticate to OpenShift using Keycloak as an Identity Provider (IDP) and that Groups from Keycloak are imported into OpenShift. This article does not cover a production grade installation of Keycloak, but only a test installation, so you can see how it works. For production, you might want to consider a proper database (maybe external, but at least with a backup), high availability, etc.).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Classic Kubernetes/OpenShift offer a feature called NetworkPolicy that allows users to control the traffic to and from their assigned Namespace.
NetworkPolicies are designed to give project owners or tenants the ability to protect their own namespace. Sometimes, however, I worked with customers where the
cluster administrators or a dedicated (network) team need to enforce these policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Since the NetworkPolicy API is namespace-scoped, it is not possible to enforce policies across namespaces. The only solution was to create custom (project) admin and edit
roles, and remove the ability of creating, modifying or deleting NetworkPolicy objects. Technically, this is possible and easily done. But shifts the whole network security to cluster administrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Luckily, this is where &lt;strong>AdminNetworkPolicy&lt;/strong> (ANP) and &lt;strong>BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy&lt;/strong> (BANP) comes into play.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today I want to demonstrate the deployment and configuration of &lt;strong>Advanced Cluster Security&lt;/strong> (ACS) using a GitOps approach. The required operator shall be installed, verified if it is running and then ACS shall be initialized. This initialization contains the deployment of several components:&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="olist arabic">
&lt;ol class="arabic">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Central - as UI and as a main component of ACS&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>SecuredClusters - installs a Scanner, Controller pods etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Console link into OpenShift UI - to directly access the ACS Central UI&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Job to create an initialization bundle to install the Secured Cluster&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Job to configure authentication using OpenShift&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>In the previous articles, we have discussed the &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/gitopscollection/2023-12-28-gitops-repostructure/">Git repository folder structure&lt;/a> and the configuration of the &lt;a href="gitopscollection/2024-04-02-configure_app_of_apps/">App-Of-Apps&lt;/a>. Now it is time to deploy our first configuration. One of the first things I usually deploy is the &lt;a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/security/compliance_operator/co-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compliance Operator&lt;/a>. This Operator is recommended for any cluster and can be deployed without any addition to the Subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this article, I will describe how it is installed and how the Helm Chart is configured.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sensitive information in OpenShift or Kubernetes is stored as a so-called Secret. The management of these Secrets is one of the most important questions,
when it comes to OpenShift. Secrets in Kubernetes are encoded in base64. This is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an encryption format.
Even if etcd is encrypted at rest, everybody can decode a given base64 string which is stored in the Secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>For example: The string &lt;code>Thomas&lt;/code> encoded as base64 is &lt;code>VGhvbWFzCg==&lt;/code>. This is simply a masked plain text and it is not secure to share these values, especially not on Git.
To make your CI/CD pipelines or Gitops process secure, you need to think of a secure way to manage your Secrets. Thus, your Secret objects must be encrypted somehow. HashiCorp Vault is one option to achieve this requirement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Securing ETCD is one of the major Day-2 tasks for a Kubernetes cluster. This article will explain how to create a backup using OpenShift Cronjob.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) Central is installed with one administrator user by default. Typically, customers request an integration with existing Identity Provider(s) (IDP). RHACS offers different options for such integration. In this article 2 IDPs will be configured as an example. First OpenShift Auth and second Red Hat Single Sign On (RHSSO) based on Keycloak&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working with a GitOps approach is a good way to keep all configurations and settings versioned and in sync on Git. Sensitive data, such as passwords to a database connection, will quickly come around.
Obviously, it is not a idea to store clear text strings in a, maybe even public, Git repository. Therefore, all sensitive information should be stored in a secret object. The problem with secrets in Kubernetes is that they are actually not encrypted. Instead, strings are base64 encoded which can be decoded as well. Thats not good …​ it should not be possible to decrypt secured data. Sealed Secret will help here…​&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As described at &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/compliance/2021/07/compliance-operator/">Compliance Operator&lt;/a> the Compliance Operator can be used to scan the OpenShift cluster environment against security benchmark, like CIS.
Fetching the actual results might be a bit tricky tough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>With OpenShift 4.8 plugins to the &lt;code>oc&lt;/code> command are allowed. One of these plugin os &lt;code>oc compliance&lt;/code>, which allows you to easily fetch scan results, re-run scans and so on.
Let’s install and try it out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OpenShift comes out of the box with a highly secure operating system, called Red Hat CoreOS. This OS is immutable, which means that no direct changes are done inside the OS, instead any configuration is managed by OpenShift itself using MachineConfig objects. Nevertheless, hardening certain settings must still be considered. Red Hat released a hardening guide (CIS Benchmark) which can be downloaded at &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/" class="bare">https://www.cisecurity.org/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
