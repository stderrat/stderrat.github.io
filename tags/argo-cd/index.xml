&lt;p>When managing one or more clusters, the question arises as to how cluster configurations and applications can be installed securely, regularly, and in the same way.
This is where the so-called GitOps approach helps, according to the mantra: &amp;#34;&lt;strong>If it is not in Git, it does not exist&lt;/strong>&amp;#34;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The idea is to have Git as the only source of truth on what happens inside the environment. While there are many articles about how to get GitOps into the deployment process of applications, this series of articles tries to set the focus on the &lt;strong>cluster configuration&lt;/strong> and tasks system administrators usually have to do, for example: Setup an Operator.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Quay Deployment and Configuration using GitOps</title><link>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2023-11-03-quay-deployment-with-gitops/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2023-11-03-quay-deployment-with-gitops/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Installing and configuring Quay Enterprise using a GitOps approach is not as easy as it sounds.
On the one hand, the operator is deployed easily, on the other hand, the configuration of Quay is quite tough to do in a declarative way and syntax rules must be strictly followed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this article, I am trying to explain how I solved this issue by using a Kubernetes Job and a Helm Chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Operator installation with Argo CD</title><link>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2023-03-20-operator-installation-with-argocd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2023-03-20-operator-installation-with-argocd/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>GitOps for application deployment and cluster configuration is a must-have I am trying to convince every customer to follow from the very beginning when starting the Kubernetes journey. For me, as more on the infrastructure side of things, I am more focused on the configuration of an environment.
Meaning, configuring a cluster, installing an operator etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this article, I would like to share how I deal with cluster configuration when certain Kubernetes objects are dependent on each other and how to use Kubernetes but also Argo CD features to resolve these dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Using ServerSideApply with ArgoCD</title><link>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2022-11-04-argocd-and-serversideapply/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2022-11-04-argocd-and-serversideapply/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>„&lt;em>If it is not in GitOps, it does not exist&lt;/em>“ - However, managing objects partially only by Gitops was always an issue, since ArgoCD would like to manage the whole object. For example, when you tried to work with node labels and would like to manage them via Gitops, you would need to put the whole node object into ArgoCD. This is impractical since the node object is very complex and typically managed by the cluster.
There were 3rd party solutions (like the patch operator), that helped with this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>However, with the Kubernetes feature &lt;strong>Server-Side Apply&lt;/strong> this problem is solved. Read further to see a working example of this feature.&lt;/p>
