&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://min.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinIO&lt;/a> is a simple, S3-compatible object storage, built for high-performance and large-scale environments. It can be installed as an Operator to Openshift. In addition, to a command line tool, it provides a WebUI where all settings can be done, especially creating and configuring new buckets. Currently, this is not possible in a declarative GitOps-friendly way.
Therefore, I created the Helm chart &lt;a href="https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/minio-configurator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minio configurator&lt;/a>, that will start a Kubernetes Job, which will take care of the configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Honestly, when I say I have created it, the truth is, that it is based on an existing &lt;a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinIO Chart by Bitnami&lt;/a>, that does much more than just set up a bucket. I took out the bucket configuration part, streamlined it a bit and added some new features, which I required.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article shall explain how to achieve this.&lt;/p>
