&lt;p>Sensitive information in OpenShift or Kubernetes is stored as a so-called Secret. The management of these Secrets is one of the most important questions,
when it comes to OpenShift. Secrets in Kubernetes are encoded in base64. This is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an encryption format.
Even if etcd is encrypted at rest, everybody can decode a given base64 string which is stored in the Secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>For example: The string &lt;code>Thomas&lt;/code> encoded as base64 is &lt;code>VGhvbWFzCg==&lt;/code>. This is simply a masked plain text and it is not secure to share these values, especially not on Git.
To make your CI/CD pipelines or Gitops process secure, you need to think of a secure way to manage your Secrets. Thus, your Secret objects must be encrypted somehow. HashiCorp Vault is one option to achieve this requirement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well we hope the articles here are not totally useless :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who are we, you might ask.
We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years. At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architectures. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested. We simply wrote down what we saw in the field and of what we thought it might be helpful, so no frustrating searches in documentations or manual testing is required. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
