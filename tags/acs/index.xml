&lt;p>The goal of the following (&amp;#34;short&amp;#34;) series is to build a secure CI/CD pipeline step by step using OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton).
The whole build process shall pull and build an image, upload it to a development environment and subsequently update the production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The main focus here is security. Several steps and tools shall help to build and deploy a &lt;strong>Secure Supply Chain&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The whole process is part of a Red Hat workshop which can present to your organization. I did some tweaks and created a step-by-step plan in order
to remember it …​ since I am getting old :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this step we will install &lt;strong>Advanced Cluster Security&lt;/strong> (ACS) and create 2 new steps in our Pipeline to scan the image for vulnerabilities and security policy. A custom security policy, configured in ACS, will verify if the image is signed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Step 11 - ACS Deployment Check</title><link>https://blog.stderr.at/securesupplychain/2023-06-26-securesupplychain-step11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.stderr.at/securesupplychain/2023-06-26-securesupplychain-step11/</guid><description>&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>After the Pipeline prepared the new image for DEV it should be checked against ACS for policy compliance. This ensures that the deployment manifest adheres to policy requirements. The command line tool &lt;strong>roxctl&lt;/strong> will be leveraged to perform this task.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) Central is installed with one administrator user by default. Typically, customers request an integration with existing Identity Provider(s) (IDP). RHACS offers different options for such integration. In this article 2 IDPs will be configured as an example. First OpenShift Auth and second Red Hat Single Sign On (RHSSO) based on Keycloak&lt;/p>

Who are we, you might ask. We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years (each or us). At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architecture.
The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested.</description></item></channel></rss>
