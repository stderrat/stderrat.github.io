&lt;p>The following 1-minute article is a follow-up to my &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2025/05/step-by-step-using-keycloak-authentication-in-openshift/">previous article&lt;/a> about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. In this article, I will show you how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift for Single Log Out (SLO). This means that when you log out from Keycloak, you will also be logged out from OpenShift automatically. This requires some additional configuration in Keycloak and OpenShift, but it is not too complicated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was recently asked about how to use Keycloak as an authentication provider for OpenShift. How to install Keycloak using the Operator and how to configure Keycloak and OpenShift so that users can log in to OpenShift using OpenID.
I have to admit that the exact steps are not easy to find, so I decided to write a blog post about it, describing each step in detail.
This time I will not use GitOps, but the OpenShift and Keycloak Web Console to show the steps, because before we put it into GitOps, we need to understand what is actually happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article tries to explain every step required so that a user can authenticate to OpenShift using Keycloak as an Identity Provider (IDP) and that Groups from Keycloak are imported into OpenShift. This article does not cover a production grade installation of Keycloak, but only a test installation, so you can see how it works. For production, you might want to consider a proper database (maybe external, but at least with a backup), high availability, etc.).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) Central is installed with one administrator user by default. Typically, customers request an integration with existing Identity Provider(s) (IDP). RHACS offers different options for such integration. In this article 2 IDPs will be configured as an example. First OpenShift Auth and second Red Hat Single Sign On (RHSSO) based on Keycloak&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well we hope the articles here are not totally useless :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who are we, you might ask.
We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years. At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architectures. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested. We simply wrote down what we saw in the field and of what we thought it might be helpful, so no frustrating searches in documentations or manual testing is required. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
