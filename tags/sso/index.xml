Who are we, you might ask. We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years (each or us). At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architecture.
The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested.</description></item></channel></rss>
