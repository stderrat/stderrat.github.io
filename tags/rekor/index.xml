&lt;p>Since the image has been deployed on DEV now, we need to prepare everything for production. Before we start, we need to confirm that the whole signing process has been passed and that our signature has been applied correctly. With CoSign we signed our image and used Rekor to create a transparency log. We will use this log to confirm that the image was signed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you reached this article, congratulations! You read through tons of pages to build up a Pipeline. The last two steps in our Pipeline are: Creating a new branch and creating a pull request, with the changes of the image tag that must be approved and will be merged then (We will not update the main branch directly!). Finally, we will do a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; update to the application to see the actual changes.&lt;/p>
