&lt;p>Lately I came across several issues where a given Helm Chart must be modified after it has been rendered by Argo CD.
Argo CD does a &lt;strong>helm template&lt;/strong> to render a Chart. Sometimes, especially when you work with Subcharts or when a specific setting is not yet supported by the Chart, you need to modify it later …​ you need to post-render the Chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this very short article, I would like to demonstrate this on a real-live example I had to do. I would like to inject annotations to a Route objects, so that the certificate can be injected. This is done by the cert-utils operator.
For the post-rendering the Argo CD repo pod will be extended with a sidecar container, that is watching for the repos and patches them if required.&lt;/p>
