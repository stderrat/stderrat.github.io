&lt;p>Working with a GitOps approach is a good way to keep all configurations and settings versioned and in sync on Git. Sensitive data, such as passwords to a database connection, will quickly come around.
Obviously, it is not a idea to store clear text strings in a, maybe even public, Git repository. Therefore, all sensitive information should be stored in a secret object. The problem with secrets in Kubernetes is that they are actually not encrypted. Instead, strings are base64 encoded which can be decoded as well. Thats not good …​ it should not be possible to decrypt secured data. Sealed Secret will help here…​&lt;/p>
