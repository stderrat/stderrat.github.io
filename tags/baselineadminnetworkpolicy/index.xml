&lt;p>Classic Kubernetes/OpenShift offer a feature called NetworkPolicy that allows users to control the traffic to and from their assigned Namespace.
NetworkPolicies are designed to give project owners or tenants the ability to protect their own namespace. Sometimes, however, I worked with customers where the
cluster administrators or a dedicated (network) team need to enforce these policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Since the NetworkPolicy API is namespace-scoped, it is not possible to enforce policies across namespaces. The only solution was to create custom (project) admin and edit
roles, and remove the ability of creating, modifying or deleting NetworkPolicy objects. Technically, this is possible and easily done. But shifts the whole network security to cluster administrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>Luckily, this is where &lt;strong>AdminNetworkPolicy&lt;/strong> (ANP) and &lt;strong>BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy&lt;/strong> (BANP) comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
