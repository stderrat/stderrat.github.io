&lt;p>In the previous articles, we have discussed the &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/gitopscollection/2023-12-28-gitops-repostructure/">Git repository folder structure&lt;/a> and the configuration of the &lt;a href="gitopscollection/2024-04-02-configure_app_of_apps/">App-Of-Apps&lt;/a>. Now it is time to deploy our first configuration. One of the first things I usually deploy is the &lt;a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/security/compliance_operator/co-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compliance Operator&lt;/a>. This Operator is recommended for any cluster and can be deployed without any addition to the Subscription.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this article, I will describe how it is installed and how the Helm Chart is configured.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As described at &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/compliance/2021/07/compliance-operator/">Compliance Operator&lt;/a> the Compliance Operator can be used to scan the OpenShift cluster environment against security benchmark, like CIS.
Fetching the actual results might be a bit tricky tough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>With OpenShift 4.8 plugins to the &lt;code>oc&lt;/code> command are allowed. One of these plugin os &lt;code>oc compliance&lt;/code>, which allows you to easily fetch scan results, re-run scans and so on.
Letâ€™s install and try it out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OpenShift comes out of the box with a highly secure operating system, called Red Hat CoreOS. This OS is immutable, which means that no direct changes are done inside the OS, instead any configuration is managed by OpenShift itself using MachineConfig objects. Nevertheless, hardening certain settings must still be considered. Red Hat released a hardening guide (CIS Benchmark) which can be downloaded at &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/" class="bare">https://www.cisecurity.org/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Who are we, you might ask. We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years (each or us). At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architecture.
The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested.</description></item></channel></rss>
