&lt;p>The goal of the following (&amp;#34;short&amp;#34;) series is to build a secure CI/CD pipeline step by step using OpenShift Pipelines (based on Tekton).
The whole build process shall pull and build an image, upload it to a development environment and subsequently update the production environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The main focus here is security. Several steps and tools shall help to build and deploy a &lt;strong>Secure Supply Chain&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The whole process is part of a Red Hat workshop which can present to your organization. I did some tweaks and created a step-by-step plan in order
to remember it …​ since I am getting old :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well we hope the articles here are not totally useless :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who are we, you might ask.
We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years. At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architectures. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested. We simply wrote down what we saw in the field and of what we thought it might be helpful, so no frustrating searches in documentations or manual testing is required. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
