&lt;p>One of the most commonly deployed operators in OpenShift environments is the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Operator&lt;/strong>. It automates the management of TLS certificates for applications running within the cluster, including their issuance and renewal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The tool supports a variety of certificate issuers by default, including ACME, Vault, and self-signed certificates. Whenever a certificate is needed, Cert-Manager will automatically create a CertificateRequest resource that contains the details of the certificate. This resource is then processed by the appropriate issuer to generate the actual TLS certificate. The approval process in this case is usually fully automated, meaning that the certificate is issued without any manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>But what if you want to have more control? What if certificate issuance must follow strict organizational policies, such as requiring a specifc country code or organization name?
This is where the &lt;strong>CertificateRequestPolicy&lt;/strong> resource, a resource provided by the Approver Policy, comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article walks through configuring the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Approver Policy&lt;/strong> in OpenShift to enforce granular policies on certificate requests.&lt;/p>
