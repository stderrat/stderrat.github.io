&lt;p>While Node Affinity is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the exact opposite. Nodes can be configured with one or more taints, which mark the node in a way to only accept pods that do tolerate the taints. The tolerations themselves are applied to pods, telling the scheduler to accept a taints and start the workload on a tainted node.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>A common use case would be to mark certain nodes as infrastructure nodes, where only specific pods are allowed to be executed or to taint nodes with a special hardware (i.e. GPU).&lt;/p>
