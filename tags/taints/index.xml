&lt;p>While Node Affinity is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, taints are the exact opposite. Nodes can be configured with one or more taints, which mark the node in a way to only accept pods that do tolerate the taints. The tolerations themselves are applied to pods, telling the scheduler to accept a taints and start the workload on a tainted node.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>A common use case would be to mark certain nodes as infrastructure nodes, where only specific pods are allowed to be executed or to taint nodes with a special hardware (i.e. GPU).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well we hope the articles here are not totally useless :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who are we, you might ask.
We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years. At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architectures. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested. We simply wrote down what we saw in the field and of what we thought it might be helpful, so no frustrating searches in documentations or manual testing is required. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
