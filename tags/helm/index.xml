&lt;p>Lately I came across several issues where a given Helm Chart must be modified after it has been rendered by Argo CD.
Argo CD does a &lt;strong>helm template&lt;/strong> to render a Chart. Sometimes, especially when you work with Subcharts or when a specific setting is not yet supported by the Chart, you need to modify it later …​ you need to post-render the Chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>In this very short article, I would like to demonstrate this on a real-live example I had to do. I would like to inject annotations to a Route objects, so that the certificate can be injected. This is done by the cert-utils operator.
For the post-rendering the Argo CD repo pod will be extended with a sidecar container, that is watching for the repos and patches them if required.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the article &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/gitopscollection/2024-02-02-setup-argocd/">Install GitOps to the cluster&lt;/a> OpenShift GitOps is deployed using a shell script. This should be the very first installation and the only deployment that is done manually on a cluster. This procedure automatically installs the so-called &lt;strong>App-of-Apps&lt;/strong> named &lt;strong>Argo CD Resources Manager&lt;/strong> which is responsible for all further Argo CD Applications and ApplicationSets. No other configuration should be done manually if possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article will demonstrate how to configure the App-of-Apps in an easy and declarative way, using ApplicationSet mainly.&lt;/p>
