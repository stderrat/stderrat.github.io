&lt;p>One of the most commonly deployed operators in OpenShift environments is the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Operator&lt;/strong>. It automates the management of TLS certificates for applications running within the cluster, including their issuance and renewal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>The tool supports a variety of certificate issuers by default, including ACME, Vault, and self-signed certificates. Whenever a certificate is needed, Cert-Manager will automatically create a CertificateRequest resource that contains the details of the certificate. This resource is then processed by the appropriate issuer to generate the actual TLS certificate. The approval process in this case is usually fully automated, meaning that the certificate is issued without any manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>But what if you want to have more control? What if certificate issuance must follow strict organizational policies, such as requiring a specifc country code or organization name?
This is where the &lt;strong>CertificateRequestPolicy&lt;/strong> resource, a resource provided by the Approver Policy, comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>This article walks through configuring the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Approver Policy&lt;/strong> in OpenShift to enforce granular policies on certificate requests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The article &lt;a href="https://blog.stderr.at/openshift/2023/02/ssl-certificate-management-for-openshift-on-aws/">SSL Certificate Management for OpenShift on AWS&lt;/a> explains how to use the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Operator&lt;/strong> to request and install a new SSL Certificate.
This time, I would like to leverage the GitOps approach using the Helm Chart &lt;a href="https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/cert-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cert-manager&lt;/a> I have prepared to deploy the Operator and order new Certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>I will use an ACME Letsencrypt issuer with a DNS challenge. My domain is hosted at AWS Route 53.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="paragraph">
&lt;p>However, any other integration can be easily used.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, after a long time on my backlog, I had some time to look into the &lt;strong>Cert-Manager Operator&lt;/strong> and use this Operator to automatically issue new SSL certificates.
This article shall show step-by-step how to create a certificate request and use this certificate for a Route and access a service via your Browser.
I will focus on the technical part, using a given domain on AWS Route53.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well we hope the articles here are not totally useless :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Who are we, you might ask.
We (Thomas Jungbauer and Toni Schmidbauer) are two old IT guys, working in the business since more than 20 years. At the moment we are architects at Red Hat Austria, mainly responsible helping customers with OpenShift or Ansible architectures. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The articles in this blog shall help to easily test and understand specific issues so they can be reproduced and tested. We simply wrote down what we saw in the field and of what we thought it might be helpful, so no frustrating searches in documentations or manual testing is required. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
